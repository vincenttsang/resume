\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Hi-Responsive Scheduler for Hadoop YARN}{July 2015 - June 2016}{Research Assistant, supervised by Prof. Yushan SUN}{HIT-Neighbor System Joint R\&D Center}
\item We designed a light-weight virtual size calculation approach for Hadoop YARN.
\item We proposed a novel job size prediction approach to do size-based scheduling on YARN.
\item We carried out experiments on our FSPY scheduler and compared the results with Fair scheduler, noticing a
substantial improvement in terms of response time while maintaining similar fairness.
\end{rSubsection}


%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Motion Planning\&RoboDance Implementation}{May 2015 - Jan 2016}{Leader}{HIT Robot Innovation Workshop}
\item Implemented a robot motion planning system to automatically construct consecutive motions for the switch
between dierent robot poses and ensure the robot stability in the switch process.
\item Programmed humanoid robot dance and solved the synchronization problem among multiple robots.
\item Led workshop members to bring our robot dance on grand stages like charity ceremony and received interviews
from local media.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Flash Vocabulary - A lightweight website for boosting vocabulary online}{June - July 2015}{Leader}{HIT-Neighbor System Joint R\&D Center}
\item Devised a novel MVC-derived pattern that best t the interaction mode of our website.
\item Proposed Nearest Recital and Random Select approaches and perfectly combined them with Ebbinghaus Memory Rule to ensure users a solid memory of vocabulary.
\item Developed a comprehensive front-end framework to simplify front-end codes and create a universal UI.
\item Adopted AJAX and HTML5 Local Storage to avoid unnecessary reloading and enhance user experience.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{Jizhi Tutor Service Platform}{Apr. - June 2014}{Co-Leader}{Jizhi Pioneering Group}
\item Analyzed market requirements by surveying the target market (students and parents).
\item Designed the architecture, database and user interface of the platform with my partner.
\item Implemented core business logic and adopted JQuery, Bootstrap to enhance visual effects.
\item Independently deployed, operated and maintained the website on cloud.
\end{rSubsection}

%------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSubsection}{General Coding - An APP to improve programmers' productivity}{Dec. 2013 - Apr. 2014}{Core Developer}{HIT Network Center}
\item Collaborated with the other teammate to design core data structure and algorithms.
\item Created an interface for standard API document extension, making the application highly extendible.
\item Implemented an objective linked-list and the fuzzy query algorithm (Levenshtein Distance) in our Full-Text
Inter-PL (Programming Language) API search engine.
